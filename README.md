# Liar's Dice

Small text game project, made to practice making unit tests, with the use of unittest. It follows basic rules of Liar's Dice.

## Game Description

Liar's Dice is a dice game based on bluffing and probability. Each player receives a set of dice, which they roll in secret. Players take turns bidding on how many dice of a particular value are in play, with each subsequent bid needing to be "higher" than the previous one. When a player believes the previous bid is too high (i.e., the previous player is bluffing), they can challenge it. The loser loses one die, and a player who loses all their dice is eliminated from the game. The last player who still has dice wins.

### Rules

1. **Start**: Each player receives the same number of dice (default is 5).
2. **Round Process**:
   - All players roll their dice simultaneously, hiding the results from others.
   - Players take turns bidding on how many dice of a particular value are in play.
   - A bid consists of a quantity and a value (e.g., "three 4s").
   - Each subsequent bid must be higher than the previous one.
   - A player can challenge the previous bid if they think it's too high.
3. **Challenge Resolution**:
   - After challenging a bid, all players reveal their dice.
   - The number of dice with the specified value is counted.
   - If the count is less than the bid, the bidder loses.
   - If the count is equal to or greater than the bid, the challenger loses.
4. **Penalty**: The loser loses one die.
5. **Game End**: The last player with dice remaining wins.

```
pylint src/ tests/ main.py
```

You can check a specific file:
```
pylint src/dice.py
```

### Running Mypy
